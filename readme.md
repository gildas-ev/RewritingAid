# RewritingAid
TTS Text To Speech to help you rewrite faster. I developed this program during 2020 lockdown (SARS-CoV-2 crisis) to help rewriting remote courses

### Prerequisites
Please install the needed packages in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) :

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
Paste your text in the [text.txt](text.txt) file.
Start [tts.py](tts.py) and specify the rewriting speed in wpm (word per minute). 20wpm is a good start.
